	migrate: The migrate command looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in your mysite
		 settings.py file and the database migrations shipped with the app

	makemigrations:  telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be 
                         stored as a migration. Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models

	sqlmigrate: The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns their SQL.The sqlmigrate command doesn’t actually run the migration on your database - 
                    it just prints it to the screen so that you can see what SQL Django thinks is required. It’s useful for checking what Django is going to 
                    do or if you have database administrators who require SQL scripts for changes.
